## Introduction

This package provides the core functionality of Cachet and may be installed into existing Laravel applications. Cachet 3.x will ship as a standalone Laravel application that requires this package.

## Development

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run the following commands from within the `core` directory:
    ```shell
   composer update
   npm install
   npm run build
    ```
3. Start running Cachet via the Orchestra Workbench:
    ```shell
   composer start
    ```
4. From within the `core` directory, you can now run to actively compile the frontend assets:
    ```shell
    npm run dev
    ```
5. Make your changes to the frontend. Currently, HMR is not enabled so manual refreshes are needed.

### Dashboard Credentials

When running Cachet via the `composer start` command, Workbench will seed a user that you can use to log in to the dashboard.
Login to the account at `/status/dashboard` and use credentials:

- **Email:** `test@test.com`
- **Password:** `test123`
